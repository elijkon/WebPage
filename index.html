<p>This archive is a curated visual database featuring high-resolution images of performance vehicles, supercars, and rare models. 
Each entry is cataloged with relevant metadata, including manufacturer, model, engine type, color, and 0-60 mph 
acceleration. The goal of this project is to create an organized and searchable reference for 
researchers and developers interested in automotive specifications and design analysis.</br> </p>
